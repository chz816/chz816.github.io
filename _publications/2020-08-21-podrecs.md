Abstract:

Podcast summary, an important factor affecting end-usersâ€™ listening decisions, has often been considered a critical feature in pod- cast recommendation systems, as well as many downstream appli- cations. Existing abstractive summarization approaches are mainly built on fine-tuned models on professionally edited texts such as CNN and DailyMail news. Different from news, podcasts are of- ten longer, more colloquial and conversational, and nosier with contents on commercials and sponsorship, which makes automatic podcast summarization extremely challenging. This paper presents a baseline analysis of podcast summarization using the Spotify Podcast Dataset provided by TREC 2020. It aims to help researchers understand current state-of-the-art pre-trained models and hence build a foundation for creating better models.
