Hi!

My name is Rachel Chujie Zheng (郑楚洁). I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute for Financial Services Analytics](https://lerner.udel.edu/centers/institute-for-financial-services-analytics/), University of Delaware. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Harry Jiannan Wang](https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/jiannan-harry-wang/).

My research topics include Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am expected to graduate in Spring 2022.

I am also enrolled in the [Online Master of Computer Science program](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I am expected to finish the coursework in Summer 2022.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent two wonderful years at Lehigh University and received my master’s degree in Financial Engineering in 2018. Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Finance from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China in 2016.
