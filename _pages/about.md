Hi!

My name is Rachel Chujie Zheng. I am currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at the University of Delaware. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Harry Jiannan Wang](https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/jiannan-harry-wang/).
My research topics include Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Machine Learning. I am expected to graduate in Spring 2020.

I am also enrolled in the Online Master of Computer Science program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I am expected to finish the coursework in the summer of 2022.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent two wonderful years at Lehigh University and received my master’s degree in Financial Engineering in 2018. Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Finance from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China in 2016.
