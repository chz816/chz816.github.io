Hi!

My name is Rachel Chujie Zheng. I am currently a 2nd-year Ph.D student at the University of Delaware, whose research focuses on Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Harry Jiannan Wang.

Prior to starting my PhD, I received my master’s degree in Financial Engeering from Lehigh University in 2018. Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree in Finance from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China in 2016.
